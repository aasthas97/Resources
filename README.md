# Resources

A collection of resources (mostly pertaining to cognitive science) found while exploring the world wide web. This repo also contains my views on things that interest me and (random) code. Feel free to use. Please note that **some of this work is not owned by me, so give due credit**!

## Guide
1. ```external``` contains links to useful webpages, with short descriptions.
2. ```exp``` contains little experiments of my own.
3. ```readings``` contains relevant readings.
