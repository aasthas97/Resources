# NeuroMatch Academy Resources

## July 13-31, 2020

A collection of resources shared during NMA 2020 - either by the academy itself or by other members of the community (students, TAs, etc.). This repo also contains tutorial solutions and other (sometimes random) code written during and after NMA. Feel free to use. Please note that <b> some of this work is not owned by me, so give due credit </b>!
